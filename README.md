# Swing_Trader_IO

Update:
It seems like my only choise is to learn a bit a python on use an api to request stock market data. Luckily I already have a membership to an trader and can grant me access to their api.

So I am shifting focus for now temperarly. Instead of building the project entirerly from the ground up and collect data as I build functionality I will probabily have to make a build fake data to use on project. 
Downside:
I wont be able to test trading strategies because more likely than not the charts will be randomly genereated in order to not waste much time. Thus I will focus on building functionality to the sql query and multithreading parititions to the project.
